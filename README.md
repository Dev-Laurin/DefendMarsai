# Defend Marsai
A fireemblem like strategy game. 

## Design 
* Units will have fatigue. Each battle or action (not movement) will increase their fatigue. Support classes can reduce this for other units. 
* Weapons will have durability and classes. 
* I don't know if I'll have a weapons triangle, or some weapons will just be better than others (or the same all around). 
* Units can have sub-classes with a max of 2 (can normally be a swordsman but can learn to draw a bow, giving 2 ways to attack). 
* I want to have something to do between battles. FE is fun, but it can be repetitive to do batte after battle. I'd like to add 
more strategy by making you choose which battles on the main map (where to defend) and be responsible for villages' wellbeing. You'll
also need enough supplies for your army (food, boots, weapons). 
* in spirit battles it follows a defender, attacker, support class style where each unit can be whatever you choose 
however, each unit needs different levels of rest and has to switch at some point. (defender can only take so many attacks then theyre exhausted) 
* each character will be great at one class and weaker in the others. youll want to save their best abilities for certain times in battle
* in the spirit world you play as God, where you command your units against the forces of darkness.
* The player gets to choose which form of God they see (like skins) that the bible describes God as: The lion, eyes with flames, etc. I think also
having a boy with gold eyes and white hair with any chooseable skin color would work as one of the forms as well.
* Angels should not look like people, but the forms the bible describes.

## Story 
* follows the Henry and Petunia medeival story line. 
The game starts as like a simple fire emblem game but when 
Petunia gets saved the game shows the spirit battles alomg with 
the physical gameplay. Petunia is awakened in the 
spirit world by her body coming to life out of the grave. 

## Enemy Design
### Easy
Start with 'Easy' AI where it chooses a unit randomly within range.
### Medium
AI picks the weakest unit to attack, priorizing finishing a unit off.
### Hard 
AI uses a deep search to 'lookahead' at the possible moves and chooses the best path for its advantage. 
### Impossible
AI model is trained over generations by other AIs.
